  <p class="text-justify" >
    A home insurance is a property insurance policy to help you cover your own home or rented apartment, and your personal belongings within, from unforeseen circumstances such as burglaries, fires, floods, storms and explosions. 
    Buying a house is one of the most vital investments people spend all their life working towards. Yet, there are so many people who forget to secure and protect for this very important investment in their life. From your cutting-edge gadgets and beautiful interiors to your jewellery and other valuable belongings; your home is more than just its mere physical property and is a lot more valuable than you imagine it to be.
    That’s why, one of the most essential things you could do for the wellbeing and safety of your home is at least get a home insurance that would allow you to stay secured and covered for in the case of uncertain and unfortunate circumstances such as burglaries, floods, fires, and earthquakes amongst other likely, but unforeseen circumstances. Our Go Digit, Bharat Griha Raksha Policy (UIN - IRDAN158RP0081V01202021) with optional add-on for valuables like jewellery will help you secure your home and valuables.
    To ensure that your home is secured against burglaries as well, you can combine the Digit Burglary Insurance policy with your Home Insurance policy.</p>

<h1 class="text-center" style="color: rgb(252, 115, 65);">What is property in Home Insurance?</h1>
<p  class="text-justify">Property insurance provides financial reimbursement to the owner or renter of a structure and
   its contents in case there is damage or theft—and to a person other than the owner or renter if that person is 
   injured on the property.Property insurance is insurance coverage meant to protect an individual’s property. 
   It is an agreement between the insurer and the insured against the damage, loss, or other mishappenings to the individual’s property. The insured/policyholder has the right to pay the premium amounts to the insurance company every month or annually, depending on the type of policy. In return, the insurer promises to protect and reimburse the amount in
  line with the policy at the time of damage to the property. </p>
